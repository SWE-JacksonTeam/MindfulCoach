but what if user inputs a string?
"How are you sir?"

Tokenization:-
we need to break down the string into tokens like:
->"How" "are" "you" "sir" "?"
"aren't you happy with money?"
->"are" "n't" "you" "with" "money"

Stemming:
removed the end making the word more general.
"organize" "organizes" "organizing"
-> ["organ", "organ", "organ"]
